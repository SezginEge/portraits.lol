    <p class="mb-6">Welcome to Portraits.lol! By placing an order with us, you agree to these terms. We try to keep
      things light-hearted, but here are the important bits.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Order Policy</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">Once we start working on your portrait, it’s locked in—no refunds or cancellations. Every portrait
      is a unique masterpiece (or a hilarious attempt at one) made just for you.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Delivery Timeline</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">We aim to deliver your custom portrait within 1-2 weeks. Sometimes it might take a bit longer—art
      (even our goofy kind) takes time, and we appreciate your patience.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Image Submission Guidelines</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">We reserve the right to refuse images that are inappropriate, offensive, or violate any laws. Keep
      it fun and family-friendly—no weird stuff, please!</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Usage Rights</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">By sending us your photo, you grant us permission to use the resulting portrait for promotional
      purposes. If you’d rather keep your masterpiece under wraps, let us know at <strong>funny@portraits.lol</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Do Whatever You Want</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">It’s your portrait—use it however you like! Frame it, share it, make it your profile picture, or
      print it on a pillow. Once you get it, it’s all yours.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">6. No Promises, No Guarantees</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">We’re amateurs, not art critics. Our style is… let’s call it “free-spirited.” What you get is what
      you get—no revisions, no touch-ups, no guarantees.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Liability Disclaimer</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">Our portraits are for laughs only. If you find your likeness a bit too "abstract," we take no
      responsibility—except for giving you a smile.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p class="mb-6">Have questions? Concerns? Want to share your favorite portrait? Email us at
